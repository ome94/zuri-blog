# Zuri Blog
This is what started as a submission for the django Blog Task.

I continued work on it to acquaint myself better with the **Django** framework and also improve my skills in other aspects of development and design including:
* Database design (*`SQL`*)
* I'll keep improving on the UI also with *`CSS`*
* I plan making it more accessible through the right mix of accessible *`HTML`* elements, responsive and accessible visual *`CSS`* layout and design.
* I also intend making it a progressive web app (*`PWA`*) as development progresses.
* That means it msy functions as a single-page web app (*`SPA`*) also.

It's live on [heroku](http://ome-zuri-blog.herokuapp.com).

Development of this personal adventure was halted when my system got stolen,
I had it in mind to keep working it and add features to it as much as it may need and as much as I can if necessary.

# Next Time
I shall be working on these:
* Break the project into components
  - Home or welcome page (about and contact may be included)
    - By refactoring my site into components and making another migrations, I lost data(Posts & Comments) in the previous models
    - How can I avoid losing my data whenever I have to make these sort of changes in a future time.
  - Users (including, auth, profile, etc)
  - Posts ()
